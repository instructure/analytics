# API for retrieving the data exposed in Canvas Analytics
class AnalyticsApiController < ApplicationController
  include Analytics::Permissions

  # @API Get department-level participation data
  #
  # Returns page view hits summed across all courses in the department. Two
  # groupings of these counts are returned; one by day (+by_date+), the other
  # by category (+by_category+). The possible categories are announcements,
  # assignments, collaborations, conferences, discussions, files, general,
  # grades, groups, modules, other, pages, and quizzes.
  #
  # This and the other department-level endpoints have three variations which
  # all return the same style of data but for different subsets of courses. All
  # share the prefix /api/v1/accounts/<account_id>/analytics. The possible
  # suffixes are:
  #
  #  * /current: includes all available courses in the default term
  #  * /completed: includes all concluded courses in the default term
  #  * /terms/<term_id>: includes all available or concluded courses in the
  #    given term.
  #
  # Courses not yet offered or which have been deleted are never included.
  #
  # /current and /completed are intended for use when the account has only one
  # term. /terms/<term_id> is intended for use when the account has multiple
  # terms.
  #
  # The action follows the suffix.

  #
  # Returns the distribution of grades for students in courses in the

  # if a student is in multiple courses, he contributes one value per course,
  # but if he's enrolled multiple times in the same course (e.g. a lecture
  # section and a lab section), he only constributes on value for that course.
  #
  # Grades are binned to the nearest integer score; anomalous grades outside
  # the 0 to 100 range are ignored. The raw counts are returned, not yet
  # normalized by the total count.
