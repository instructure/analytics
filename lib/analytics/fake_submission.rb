# standin for a Submission object that's much cheaper to instantiate, for use
# in Analytics::Course#tardiness_breakdowns.
#
# in addition to the fields for the Submission::Tardiness contract,
# Analytics::AssignmentSubmission also needs a graded_at (Time) attribute.
#
# finally, Analytics::Course#tardiness_breakdown also requires assignment_id
# (Integer) and user_id (Integer).
